> your friends into a list, it takes to `parameters` (name, contact), you also have the `view_contact` method to view a list of your friends (added friends)

> The `add_contact` checks if the `name` you want to add is a string datatype, if not the method returns a `False`, the method also checks if the name intended to be added is already in the list, if yes (Y) then asks you want to forcefully add the name, a prompt comes up and if your respond is (`Y`), it then checks if the `contact` is already in the list, and then makes a decision whether to add the friend or not....
